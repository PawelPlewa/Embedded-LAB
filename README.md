# Embedded-LAB

An experimental repository created after first 2 semester of studying IoT at the Warsaw University of Technology.
Its primary purposes are tests and prototyping within the field of embedded systems.

Here is where I:
- create early "alpha" versions of drivers (for e.g. sensors, ADCs, etc.),
- have fun with microcontrollers (ESP32, nRF, etc.),
- test various hardware modules and sensors,
- write utility tools and helpers.

**NOTE** This repository does **NOT** guarantee that the code here is fully functional,
certain things might be in a "work in progress" or "works for me" state.
If you are looking for ready-to-use, well-structured drivers, check out (COMING SOON).
